# Advent of Code 2020
Hi all, this is my repo for my [Advent of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020) solutions. For this year's challenge, I will be trying out [Julia](https://julialang.org/), a high-performance dynamic programming language.

I also do science things, check out my twitter [@lucassterzinger](https://www.twitter.com/lucassterzinger)!

## Danger, poor coding practices await you in this repo
